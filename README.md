# 4-bit CPU in Verilog

A simple 4-bit CPU designed and implemented in Verilog as a learning project to understand fundamental computer architecture concepts.

## 📋 About This Project

This CPU was built as an educational exercise to learn how processors work from the ground up. The project was developed with significant assistance from Claude AI, serving as a guided learning experience through CPU design and Verilog HDL.

**Purpose:** To understand the fundamental components of a CPU and how they work together to execute instructions.

## ✨ Features

- **4-bit data path** - operates on 4-bit values
- **4 general-purpose registers** (R0, R1, R2, R3)
- **8-bit instruction format** - simple and easy to understand
- **7 operations:** ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, NOT, MOV
- **External program loading** - programs loaded from `.mem` files
- **256 instruction capacity** - 8-bit program counter
